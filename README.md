# Prework - Prework Demo

Submitted by: Monika Jankun-Kelly

Prework Demo is an app that demonstrates my readiness to begin the iOS dev course.
It shows my ability to create a simple iOS app and run it in a simulator.

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total (includes tool setup, doc reading)

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are able to see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

The following changes have been made:

- [x] colors a lighter, not overly saturated, rgb (0.3,1), not (0,1)
- [x] colors are fully opaque, alpha is 1, not 0.5
- [x] cute graphic added, rainbow from free clipart site (credits below)
 
## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

These are some of my favorite apps and their good features.

1. Messages
     * simple interface, very quick and easy to use
     * very useful in my day to day life
     
2. Canvas Teacher for mobile
     * allows me to grade student work on my phone
       at times when grading on a laptop is not convenient or not doable
     * the interface for the mobile app is simplified compared to the web app,
       thus it is easy to read and easy to use on a device with a small screen
       and no keyboard
       
3. Minecraft and Stardew Valley
     * immensely fun, replayable for years
     * great mobile device UI, intuitive, easy to use, mostly uses taps
     
Idea for a new app: Voter Info

I would like to have a voter info app that provides information about upcoming
local, state, and federal elections. This would be similar to the paper voter info
ballots give to people in California. Such information is deliberately withheld
where I live in Mississippi to decrease voter turnout and voter knowledge about
candidates and issues. A free app mandated by the feds and maintained by local
independent voting boards could greatly help with both voter knowledge and turnout.
A requirement to submit candidate statements and an easily searchable database
of voting records could decrease misinformation and lies by candidates.

This app would provide the following functionality:

* quick info about the next election: what election, where to vote, when to vote
* election dates would be automatically put in your calendar with alerts
* candidate list for the upcoming election, their positions on issues and voting records
* searchable database of voting records of elected officials, not just future candidates
* list of all upcoming elections (local, state, federal)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

* my Markdown is rusty so if this looks wonky, that's why
* unfamiliarity with XCode and Swift
* no experience making gif screen caps before this week
* new to GitHub 

These are all minor challenges and the point of this course is to overcome them.
